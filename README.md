Today was the first gmeet, and we had an informal introduction session. We planned how to best utilize these study sessions.

- We decided that Mon - Sat we would do the usual discussion on the PAs, AQs and other concepts related to the theory.
- Sundays - Discussed about doing a project among ourselves and maintaining the code in Github.
